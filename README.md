# css-grid-responsive-contact-form
This is a mobile-first responsive contact form that is created with HTML5, CSS3, and specifically uses CSS Grid. 

A backend, that actually submits the form and sends email confirmation may be added at a later date.  

At this point, I'm trying to master CSS grid, so created this for that purpose.
